# SoundSlasher
Mixer for Android
With the SoundSlasher app, the user can adjust the volume of each app, if needed. For example, reduce the sound of music and simultaneously work in another application, which also has its own sound. Or, listen to voice messages without turning off the movie or stopping the music, but only muffling their sound. The user will no longer return to applications to re-enable music or pause a movie
